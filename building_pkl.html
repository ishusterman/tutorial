<p>Accessibility computations are based on repeating calculations of the car or transit fastest routes between buildings. These computations demand topologically clean layers of roads and buildings. These layers are supplied by the user and tested and, if necessary, corrected in the <em>Data preprocessing</em> section of the Accessibility Calculator menu. The layers necessary for visualization of the accessibility calculations are also constructed at this stage. After data cleaning, to save computation time, the networks that are necessary for accessibility computations are translated into two databases, one for transit and one for car network routing. Each version of the transit or road network demands a separate database that must be stored in a dedicated folder. It is worth constructing the dataset for a large area (of up to a million buildings) that covers all potentially interesting locations and regions. The user’s data must be cleaned, and the databases must be constructed at the beginning of the accessibility study.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
The menu for data preprocessing and database construction consists of two sections (Figure 1)</p>

</div>
<p>Figure 1. Data processing section of the Accessibility Calculator menu</p><p>In this tutorial, we construct topologically correct versions of the road network and buildings and then exploit them to construct three databases – one for computing car accessibility and two for computing transit accessibility for two different versions of the transit networks. We limit our examples to the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area (TAMA), with its 250K buildings. Yet, given the GTFS datasets are provided for the entire Israel, the databases for transit routing are constructed for the whole country. Our examples below use the following data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gis_osm_roads_free</span></code> OSM TAMA road layer, August 2024.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gis_osm_buildings_a_free</span></code> OSM buildings layers for TAMA, August 2024.</p></li>
<li><p>Two versions of the GTFS databases, one for June, 2018, reflecting the state of the transit system before the Red LRT line was established in the Tel Aviv Metropolitan area and one for June, 2024, after the Red LRT line started to function. Each GTFS dataset contains <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stops.txt</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stop_times.txt</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">routes.txt</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trips.txt</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calendar.txt</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to open the layers of buildings and roads in your QGIS project before cleaning them and to validate that these are indeed the layers you plan to work with. The path to the folder that contains the GTFS dataset must be provided as a parameter of the construction procedure. The clean layers of roads and buildings, as well as the layers built for visualization, are added to your QGIS project.</p>
<section id="topological-cleaning-of-the-road-and-building-layers">
<span id="building-data-clean-road"></span><h2><span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Topological cleaning of the road and building layers<a class="headerlink" href="#topological-cleaning-of-the-road-and-building-layers" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The GIS layers of roads and buildings can be topologically inconsistent. There are many types of topological errors and the most frequent for the road network is the lack of a junction at an intersection of two visually overlapping links or two or more links that remain unconnected at a junction. In the case of the layer of buildings, the typical errors include buildings represented by the multipart polygons, buildings with holes and the same building repeated twice or more times. Accessibility computations demand car and transit routing between buildings and, thus, can go wrong if the road or building layers are topologically inconsistent. To be sure of the spatial data correctness we have included topological cleaning into the plugin. If the layers of roads and buildings are topologically correct, the cleaning procedures will not change them.</p>
<section id="cleaning-road-network">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.1. </span>Cleaning road network<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-road-network" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The road network is cleaned in three steps, applying the <span class="guilabel">v.clean</span> GRASS procedure, see details at
<a class="reference external" href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.clean.html">https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.clean.html</a>. First, the links’ ends are snapped at junctions. This is done by applying <span class="guilabel">v.clean.snap</span> with the threshold of 1 m: Links’ ends at a distance of 1 m or less from each other will be snapped to one of them. Second,  the intersecting links are broken at the points of intersection, and new junctions are created at these points applying <span class="guilabel">v.clean.break</span>. Third, the overlapping links are revealed and one of them only is preserved applying <span class="guilabel">v.clean.rmdupl</span>.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
Road layer cleaning includes two non-topological operations that ensure data consistency and make the layer ready for accessibility computations. First, if one of the fields is chosen as a link ID, the uniqueness of the values in this field is checked. If some values in this field are duplicated or NULL, the repeating or NULL values are substituted by the unique values that are counted from the MAX + 1, where MAX is the maximum value in the chosen field before the test. If the option “Create ID” is chosen, a new field <em>link_id</em> is created as the first filed in the layer’s attribute table, and filled by the consecutive integer numbers, starting from 0.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The OSM layer of roads contains significant topological errors and the cleaning procedures that we employ in the Accessibility Calculator make this layer topologically consistent. However, it may happen that, contextually, the layer of roads does not reflect the real structure of the road network. One of the ways to test this is to manually employ the <span class="guilabel">v.clean</span> procedures, in the same order as mentioned above and with the same parameters. When cleaning procedures are applied manually, the results, at each step, include the errors report that will help you to understand the road layer inconsistencies. You can also vary the 1m threshold that we use. Then you could decide whether it is worth editing or updating the roads layer manually in case it does not properly reflect the real-world road structure.</p>

<p>Cleaning of the layer of buildings is performed in four steps. First, the features with the absent (NULL) geometry are deleted from the layer. Second, the multipart features are split into single parts, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgismultiparttosingleparts">https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgismultiparttosingleparts</a>, and, in addition, the duplicated features are deleted. Third, duplicated buildings, if they exist, are found and excessive copies are deleted. Forth, the delete holes algorithm is employed to cover holes in the buildings’ polygons, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgisdeleteholes">https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgisdeleteholes</a>. Just as it is done for the road links, the uniqueness of the values chosen as a building ID is tested and if some values in this field are duplicated or NULL, they are substituted by the unique values counted from the MAX + 1, where MAX is the maximum value in the ID field before the test. If the option “Create ID” is chosen, a new field bldg_id is created in the layer’s attribute table and filled by the consecutive integer numbers, starting from 0.

<span id="building-data-visualization"></span><h3><span class="section-number">4.1.3. </span>Building layers for visualization<a class="headerlink" href="#building-layers-for-visualization" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Accessibility Calculator assigns the values of accessibility to each accessible building and the results are visualized with the thematic maps at the resolution of buildings or lower. Buildings themselves can be used for the visualization but, a lion’s share of the constructed area is not covered by the buildings and these maps are inconvenient to use. The coverage becomes continuous if buildings are substituted by their Voronoi polygons. These polygons are built based on the building centroids, applying <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#voronoi-polygons">https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#voronoi-polygons</a> algorithm, with the Voronoi polygons’ identifiers repeating identifiers of the buildings. Voronoi polygons are clipped by layer buildings’ centroids buffers of 50m radius, to avoid large Voronoi polygons that always appear at the boundary of the constructed area. In addition to constructing the layer of Voronoi polygons of buildings, the layers of hexagons can be constructed. The defaults are hexagon layers of the 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 m side lengths. The user-defined layers can be constructed too applying the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html#create-grid">https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html#create-grid</a>  algorithm. Each layer covers the entire extent of the layer of buildings layer. In each layer, the hexagons that do not overlap any building are deleted and each hexagon has the identifier of the building that is closest to its centroid. If several buildings are at the same distance from the centroid, the minimal identifier is chosen. Note that the same building may be closest to more than one hexagon’s centroids and in this case, these hexagons are dissolved into one. To build layers for visualization choose the <em>Data preprocessing → Build visualization layers</em> (Figure 4):</p>

<p>To allow fast accessibility computations, the data on roads, buildings, and public transport routes and timetables are translated into a database. During this transformation, the buildings that are not connected to the road network are related to the nearest road link of the cleaned layer of roads. The shortest distance to these links is calculated, stored, and employed for establishing the network path between the building and bus stops. The result of this operation is stored in the database and the cleaned layer of roads is not changed.

<p>The car routing database is constructed based on the links’ traffic direction and maximum traffic speed, and the congestion delay coefficient that depends on the hour of a day. In the current version of the plugin, we deal with the OSM and non-OSM layers of roads slightly differently. If the source of the road layer is OSM database, then the link’s traffic direction is given on the ONEWAY attribute and the maximum traffic speed on the link (MAXSPEED attribute) is defined by the type of road link (FCLASS attribute) - a highway, major city street, neighborhood secondary street, etc. The OSM-based free flow traffic speeds <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_p\)</span>, by the road link types <em>p</em>, is given in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">car_speed_by_link_type.csv</span></code> table (Figure 6, left) and repeat the OSM free flow speed for the links of different types. This table contains three fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seq</span></code> — the sequential number of the row;</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">link_type</span></code> — the OSM type of a link;</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">speed</span></code> — the free flow car speed on the link of this type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The OSM road layer may contain links whose type is missing in this table and for these links, the <span class="guilabel">Default speed (km/h)</span> will be used.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
If the source is different, the traffic direction and the maximum traffic speed must be provided by the user.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
The average speed by hours of the day is calculated based on the Congestion Delay Index (CDI) — a ratio of the average, for the hour of a day, speed, to the free flow speed. The CDI values, by hours, are given in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cdi_index.csv</span></code> table (Figure 6, right). We constructed this table based on the Figure 7 from Wei et al, 2022, paper <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106808">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106808</a>. Both tables are supplied with the Accessibility Calculator, stored in the system folder and can be edited by the user.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
The speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_p(t)\)</span> on the link <em>p</em> at hour <em>t</em> is calculated as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_p(t) = V_p \cdot \text{CDI}_t\)</span></p>
