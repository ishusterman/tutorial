<p>Accessibility computations are based on repeating calculations of the car or transit fastest routes between buildings. These computations demand topologically clean layers of roads and buildings. These layers are supplied by the user and tested and, if necessary, corrected at the beginning of the accessibility study in the <em>Data preprocessing</em> section of the Accessibility Calculator menu (Figure 1). The layers necessary for the visualization of the accessibility calculations are also prepared at this stage.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100%;">

</div>
<p>Figure 1. Data processing section of the Accessibility Calculator menu</p><p>There are many types of topological errors and the most frequent for the road network is the lack of a junction at an intersection of two visually overlapping links or two or more links that remain unconnected at a junction. In addition, the attributes of the roads, like traffic directions, can be missing or incomplete. In the case of the layer of buildings, the typical errors include buildings represented by multipart polygons, buildings with holes, and the same building repeated twice or more times. If the layers of roads or buildings are topologically correct, the cleaning procedures will not change them.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
In this tutorial, we construct topologically correct versions of the road network and buildings and then exploit them to construct three databases – one for computing car accessibility and two for computing transit accessibility for two different versions of the transit networks. Our examples below exploit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gis_osm_roads_free</span></code> OSM TAMA road layer, August 2024.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gis_osm_buildings_a_free</span></code> OSM buildings layers for TAMA, August 2024.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to open the layers of buildings and roads in your QGIS project before cleaning them and to validate that these are indeed the layers you plan to work with. The clean layers of roads and buildings, as well as the layers built for visualization, are added to your QGIS project.</p>
<section id="cleaning-road-network">
<span id="building-data-clean-road"></span><h2><span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Cleaning road network<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-road-network" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The road network is cleaned in three steps, applying the <span class="guilabel">v.clean</span> GRASS procedure, see details at
<a class="reference external" href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.clean.html">https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.clean.html</a>. First, the links’ ends are snapped at junctions. This is done by applying <span class="guilabel">v.clean.snap</span> with the threshold of 1 m: Links’ ends at a distance of 1 m or less from each other will be snapped to one of them. Second, the intersecting links are broken at the points of intersection, and new junctions are created at these points by applying <span class="guilabel">v.clean.break</span>. Third, the overlapping links are revealed and one of them only is preserved by applying <span class="guilabel">v.clean.rmdupl</span>.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
The cleaning procedure includes a non-topological operation that ensures data consistency. Namely, if one of the fields is chosen as a link ID, the uniqueness of the values in this field is checked. If some values in this field are duplicated or NULL, the repeating or NULL values are substituted by the unique values that are counted from the MAX + 1, where MAX is the maximum value in the chosen field before the test. The user can also choose the option “Create ID” – in this case, a new field <em>link_id</em> is created as the first field in the layer’s attribute table, and filled by the consecutive integer numbers, starting from 0.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The OSM layer of roads contains significant topological errors and the cleaning procedures that we employ in the Accessibility Calculator make this layer topologically consistent. However, it may happen that the layer of roads does not reflect the real structure of the road network. Check the context of your data versus the world maps supplied by QGIS, e.g., versus Google Road maps, and add the missing or delete the excessive links.</p>

<p>Cleaning of the layer of buildings is performed in four steps. First, the features with the absent (NULL) geometry are deleted from the layer. Second, the multipart features are split into single parts, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgismultiparttosingleparts">https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgismultiparttosingleparts</a>, and, in addition, the duplicated features are deleted. Third, duplicated buildings, if they exist, are found and excessive copies are deleted. Fourth, the <em>delete holes</em> algorithm is employed to cover holes in the buildings’ polygons, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgisdeleteholes">https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#qgisdeleteholes</a>.
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
Just as it is done for the road links, the uniqueness of the values chosen as a building ID is tested and if some values in this field are duplicated or NULL, they are substituted by the unique values counted from the MAX + 1, where MAX is the maximum value in the ID field before the test. If the option “Create ID” is chosen, a new field bldg_id is created in the layer’s attribute table and filled by the consecutive integer numbers, starting from 0.

<p>Accessibility Calculator computes travel time to each accessible building and the results are visualized with the thematic maps at the resolution of buildings or lower. Buildings themselves can be used for visualization but, a lion’s share of the constructed area is not covered by the buildings and these maps are inconvenient for the eye. The coverage becomes continuous if buildings are substituted by their Voronoi polygons. These polygons are built based on the building centroids, applying <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#voronoi-polygons">https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#voronoi-polygons</a> algorithm, with the Voronoi polygons’ identifiers repeating identifiers of the buildings. Voronoi polygons are clipped by layer buildings’ centroids buffers of 50m radius, to avoid large Voronoi polygons that always appear at the boundary of the constructed area. In addition to constructing the layer of Voronoi polygons of buildings, the layers of hexagons can be constructed. The defaults are hexagon layers of the 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 m side lengths. The user-defined layers can be constructed too applying the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html#create-grid">https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html#create-grid</a>  algorithm. Each layer covers the entire extent of the layer of buildings layer. In each layer, the hexagons that do not overlap any building are deleted and each hexagon has the identifier of the building that is closest to its centroid. If several buildings are at the same distance from the centroid, the minimal identifier is chosen. Note that the same building may be closest to more than one hexagon’s centroids and in this case, these hexagons are dissolved into one. To build layers for visualization choose the <em>Data preprocessing → Build visualization layers</em> (Figure 4):</p>

Given topologically clean layers of roads and buildings, we can build databases for computing transit and car accessibility and perform accessibility computations. These two parts of the Accessibility Calculator are based on the same data but employ different algorithms, and <em>you can use this plugin for dealing with one of these two components only</em>.</p>
